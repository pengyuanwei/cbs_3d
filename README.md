# Conflict-Based Search 3D
This is a CBS implementation for anonymous MAPF with support for 3D grid maps. Same with the original resposity, the single-agent path planning method is space-time A*. You can find the implementation here: [spacs_time_a_star](https://github.com/pengyuanwei/space_time_a_star).

# Obstacles
The approach supports defining rectangular obstacles. The first obstacle is the boundary of the map.
